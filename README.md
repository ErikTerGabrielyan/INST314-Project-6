# INST314-Project-6

This dataset was collected by interviewing 10 different students at the University of Maryland about three different types of feminism; difference-denying, difference-removing, and difference-honoring, and what the interviewees would rate each type of feminism in terms of agreeability on a scale from 1-10 and what type of feminism is most present in today's society and in the past couple of decades.
